# Player Funnel & Profitability Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing player behavior and profitability using data from registrations, deposits, bets, and activity.  
The analysis was done in **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)** with results summarized in a PDF report and Excel sheets.  

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed  
- **Built Player Funnel**: Registrations → First Deposit → First Bet → Active in 30 Days, with conversion % and drop-off analysis.  
- **Retention & Engagement**: Grouped players into cohorts based on active days in first 30 days and identified which cohorts contributed most to deposits.  
- **Deposit-to-Bet Gap Analysis**: Measured time gaps (deposit vs. bet) and studied engagement impact.  
- **Player Segmentation**: Identified top 10% “whales” and measured deposit concentration vs. bottom 90%.  
- **Profitability Insights**: Compared customer-level vs. company-level profitability across deposit bins.  
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Created charts (funnels, cohorts, distributions) and summarized findings in a structured report.
